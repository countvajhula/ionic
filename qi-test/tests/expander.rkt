;; TODO: these tests compare syntax as datums, but that's not sufficient
;; since the identifiers used may be bound differently which would affect
;; e.g. literal pattern matching.
;; To do it correctly, we need an alpha-equivalence predicate for Core Qi
;; that possibly delegates to a similar predicate for any Racket
;; subexpressions. This could be a predicate that syntax-spec could
;; infer, but it's unclear at this time.
