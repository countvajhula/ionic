;; language syntax, but they also assume that the expander is functioning
;; correctly.  If there happens to be a bug in the expander, the results
;; of a test using these macros would be invalid and may cause
;; confusion. So it's important to ensure that the tests in
;; tests/expander.rkt are comprehensive.  Whenever we use these macros in
;; a test, it's worth verifying that there are corresponding tests in
;; tests/expander.rkt that validate the expansion for surface expressions
;; similar to the ones we are using in our test.
